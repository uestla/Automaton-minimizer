Automaton minimizer 1.0.0
=========================

â€¦ is a powerfull tool for handling automatons written in PHP 5.3 & based on
Nette Framework.

It can:
- load the automaton from file (format explained below)
- remove epsilon transitions
- determinize the automaton
- minimize ~
- normalize ~
- check whether given string belongs into the language described by the automaton

As said above, the definition of the automaton we want to transform has to be
saved in extra file.

Here's one simple example:

<example.txt>:
NFA  a  b  c   \eps
><A  B  -  C|A  -
  B  A  A  A|B  A
 <C  C  C  C    -


The legend is following:
The file content is actually a table describing the automaton. Each line of
the file is a row of the table and each line is splited by whitespace into
columns.

- 1st row of the file is the "heading", which contains:
	- type of the automaton ('NFA' or 'DFA' meaning non-deterministic or deterministic)
	- the alphabet - for epsilon char please use '\eps'
- all other rows contains states:
	- first columns contains state type & name:
		- '>'   means initial state
		- '<'   means final state
		- '><'  means initial and final state
		the state name must not contain any whitespace character
	- other columns describe the transitions of the state:
		- more than 1 target state are joined with '|'
		- '-'  means that the target is empty



Basic usage pattern:

$ php -f run.php <source_file> [<output_file>]
